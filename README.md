# Machine-Learning-Course-Project-NJIT
## This is  a simulated dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data  containing 29623 SNPs (total features). Amongst all SNPs are 15 causal  ones which means they and neighboring ones discriminate between case and  controls while remainder are noise.  In the training are 4000 cases and 4000 controls. Your task is to predict  the labels of 2000 test individuals whose true labels are known only to  the instructor and TA.
